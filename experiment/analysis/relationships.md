### Relationships of BST
- For a **binary tree** to be a binary search tree, the data of all the nodes in the left sub-tree of the root node should be â©½ the data of the root. The data of all the nodes in the right subtree of the root node should be > the data of the root.
- **Arrays: Linear traversal v/s Binary Serach Tree traversal**
