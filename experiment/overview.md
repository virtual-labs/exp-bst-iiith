### Motivation
_"For large amounts of input, the linear access time of linked lists is prohibitive"_ â€“ Mark Allen Weiss

### Prerequisites of the Experiment


  -  Basic knowledge of trees (data structure), and binary trees
  -  Familiarity with programming concepts such as composite data structures 
  -  Calculation of basic time and space complexity 
  - And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore..!

### Overview of the Experiment

The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, hands-on practice exercises, and quizzes for self analysis.
### Learning Objectives of the Experiment
In this experiment on Binary search tree, we will learn the following:

   - Structure, representation and implementation of BST.
   - Getting acquainted with terminologies related to trees, binary trees and BST.
   - Binary Search Tree properties and the differences between a binary tree and a binary search tree.
   - Operations on BST, their algorithms, and time and space complexity analysis.
   - Uses and relationship with other data structures such as Dictionaries and Priority Queues.
   - Applications of a BST in searching, sorting etc.
