### Motivation
For large amounts of input, the linear access time of linked lists is prohibitive â€“ weiss
### Prerequisites of the Experiment


  -  Basic knowledge of [trees (data structure), and binary trees](10.4.12.203/bst/artefacts/build/code/static/videos/BinaryTree.mp4) in particular.
  -  Familiarity with programming concepts such as [composite data structures](10.4.12.203/bst/artefacts/build/code/static/videos/Pointers%20and%20Structs.mp4).
  -  Calculation of [basic time and space complexity](10.4.12.203/bst/artefacts/build/code/static/videos/Complexity.mp4).
  - And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore..!

###Overview of the Experiment

The e xperiment features a series of modules with video lectures, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment on Binary search tree, we will learn the following:

   - Structure, representation and Implementation of BST.
   - Getting acquainted with Terminologies related to trees, Binary trees and BST.
   - Binary Search Tree property and differences between a binary tree and a binary search tree.
   - Operations on BST, their algorithms and time and space complexity analysis.
   - Uses and relationship with other data structures such as Dictionaries and priority Queues.
   - Applications of a BST in searching, sorting etc.
