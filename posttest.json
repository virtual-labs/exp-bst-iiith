      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: This is the insertion order, not the inorder traversal of the resulting BST.",
        "b": "Correct: The inorder traversal of a binary search tree always produces the elements in sorted order, regardless of the insertion sequence.",
        "c": "Incorrect: This sequence does not represent a valid inorder traversal of any BST with these elements.",

        "a": "Inorder traversal alone is sufficient",
        "b": "Postorder traversal alone is sufficient",
        "c": "Preorder traversal alone is sufficient",
        "d": "Inorder traversal alone is not sufficient because it is always sorted for a BST. We need one additional traversal (preorder or postorder) to determine the tree structure."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Inorder traversal of a BST is always sorted, so it doesn't uniquely identify the tree structure.",

        "c": "Incorrect: Preorder traversal alone cannot uniquely determine a BST without additional information.",
