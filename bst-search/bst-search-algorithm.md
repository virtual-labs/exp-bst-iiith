### Searching a node in BST

There are mainly three types of tree traversals:

- Pre-order traversal:
  In this traversal technique the traversal order is root-left-right i.e.
   - Process data of root node
   - Traverse left subtree completely
   - Then, traverse right subtree
-  Post-order traversal:
   In this traversal technique the traversal order is left-right-root i.e.
   - Process data of left subtree
   - Traverse right subtree
   - Then, traverse root node
-  In-order traversal:
   In this traversal technique the traversal order is left-root-right i.e.
   - First process left subtree (before processing root node)
   - Traverse right subtree
   - Then, traverse root node
