      "question": "1. If a binary tree has height h, what is the maximum number of nodes it can have:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "h",
        "b": "2 * h",
        "c": "2 ^ h",
        "d": "2 + h"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Height h alone doesn't determine the maximum number of nodes.",
        "b": "Incorrect: 2*h is not the correct formula for maximum nodes in a binary tree.",
        "c": "Correct: A complete binary tree of height h has 2^h - 1 nodes, so maximum is 2^h - 1 (approximately 2^h).",
        "d": "Incorrect: 2+h is not related to the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree."

      "question": "2. A binary tree has 16 nodes, what is the maximum height it can have",

      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Height 2 would allow at most 7 nodes in a binary tree.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Height 4 would allow at most 15 nodes in a binary tree.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Height 8 is not the maximum height for 16 nodes.",
        "d": "Correct: Maximum height occurs in a completely skewed tree where height = nodes - 1 = 15, and 16 is the closest available option.",
        "e": "Incorrect: Height 32 is impossible with only 16 nodes."

      "question": "3. In a binary tree, how many pointers must each node essentially have (just to maintain the tree)",

        "c": "3",

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: One pointer is insufficient for a binary tree node.",
        "b": "Correct: Each node needs two pointers - one for left child and one for right child.",
        "c": "Incorrect: Three pointers are more than necessary for a basic binary tree node.",
        "d": "Incorrect: Four pointers are more than necessary for a basic binary tree node."

      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: int variables cannot use the arrow operator (->).",
        "b": "Incorrect: int* can use -> but doesn't have an lchild member.",
        "c": "Incorrect: struct node should use dot operator (.) not arrow operator (->).",
        "d": "Correct: struct node * is a pointer to a structure that can have an lchild member and uses -> operator."
